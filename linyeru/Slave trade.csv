James Montgomery escaped a ship bound for Virginia in Port Glasgow and went to Edinburgh, but died in jail before his case was decided in 1756. In 1769, David Spens sued David Dalrymple for wrongful arrest for his trying to leave service due to ill health. Dalrymple died during the suit so Spens was automatically freed. In 1778, in a landmark case between Joseph Knight and John Wedderburn – inspired by the English Somerset v Stewart case in 1772, which prevented forced removal of slaves from England to the colonies – Knight successfully argued that slavery was not supported by Scots law. This meant runaway slaves and those who wished to leave service were now protected and could not be sent to Carribean estates against their will.","Parliament House, Parliament Square, Edinburgh, EH1 1RQ",https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk,55.948764,-3.189866
